# PlantsVsZombies Instructions
How to play Plants Vs Zombies - Created by Raymond Zhang

## Objective
Survive as long as possible to receive the highest amount of points against waves of zombies.

## Plants
There are **4 types of plants**, the `sunflower`, `peashooter`, `wallnut` and `repeater`.

The `sunflower` produces 25 sun every so often.

The `peashooter` shoots at zombies every couple seconds.

The `wallnut` has a lot more hp then a typical plant and acts as a blockade.

The `repeater` does the same as a `peashooter` but with 2 times the damage.

## Zombies
There are **3 types of zombies**, although early on you will only encounter one type.

The `basic zombie` has a decent amount of hp, but is quite weak.

The `conehead zombie` has double the hp of a `basic zombie`, but still easily manageable.

The `buckethead zombie` has triple the hp of a `basic zombie`, and may require a wallnut to stall.

## Overall Points
Your points will be determined by this formula `(totalPlants * 30 + zombiesKilled * 50 + sunGained)`.
