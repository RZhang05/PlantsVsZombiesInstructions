# PlantsVsZombies Instructions
How to play Plants Vs Zombies - Created by Raymond Zhang

## Objective
Survive as long as possible to receive the highest amount of points against waves of zombies.

## Starting off
You'll start off with `50 sun`. The game is designed so that until you plant your first plant, zombies will not spawn. `50 sun` is only enough to purchase a `sunflower`, which you should promptly do. After which, roughly 40 seconds after, the first zombies will come. Try and stock up as much sunflowers as you can early for the best chances late game.

## Plants
There are **4 types of plants**, the `sunflower`, `peashooter`, `wallnut` and `repeater`.

The `sunflower` produces 25 sun every so often.

The `peashooter` shoots at zombies every couple seconds.

The `wallnut` has a lot more hp then a typical plant and acts as a blockade.

The `repeater` does the same as a `peashooter` but with 2 times the damage.

## Zombies
There are **3 types of zombies**, although early on you will only encounter one type.

The `basic zombie` has a decent amount of hp, but is quite weak.

The `conehead zombie` has double the hp of a `basic zombie`, but still easily manageable.

The `buckethead zombie` has triple the hp of a `basic zombie`, and may require a wallnut to stall.

## Overall Points
Your points will be determined by this formula `(totalPlants * 30 + zombiesKilled * 50 + sunGained)`.

## Tips
Since the spawning formula of `zombies` is exponential, there is a certain point where you will be unable to beat the `zombies` anymore. Another note is that with this exponential increase, you should be prepared in advance for a massive rise in the number of zombies appearing as well as a rise in their difficulty levels.
